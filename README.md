## Dictionary

The dictionary key takes only one argument: a **string** determining which dictionary to use when generating new names for classes and its members. Valid dictionaries are: **Spaces**, **Unrecognized**, **Alphabetical** and **Alphanumeric**.

## TrashClasses

The trash classes key takes only one argument: a **integer** determining how many trash classes should be generated. Any integer less than or equal to zero will disable trash classes.

## Libraries

The libraries key only takes one argument: a **list of strings** containing the paths of libraries the input jar is dependant on.

## Exclusions

The exclusions key takes only one argument: a **list of strings** containing exempts detailing how Radon should treat each class.

# Exclusions

Exclusions takes the following format: `<ExclusionType>: <ExclusionHere>` to dictate how Radon should treat exclusions. Exclusion statements are treated as **regular expressions**.

To exclude methods, you must use the format: `<ExclusionType>: <ContainingClass>\.<MethodName><MethodDescription>`. Fields are excluded in the format `<ExclusionType>: <ContainingClass>\.<FieldName>\.<FieldDescription>`.

All classes, methods, and fields are checked against exclusion __***at their internal bytecode representations***__. This means that

```java
package me.itzsomebody;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Test");
    }
}
```

will be seen as `me/itzsomebody/Test.main([Ljava/lang/String;)V` to Radon. Valid exclusion types you can use are:

| Exclusion Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Global | Exempts a class/method/field from any kind of tampering (except for watermarking). |
| StringEncryption | Exempts a class/method from having its string literals encrypted. |
| InvokeDynamic | Exempts a class/method from having its method calls hidden with invokedynamic instructions. |
| FlowObfuscation | Exempts a class/method from having its methods flow-obfuscated. |
| LineNumbers | Exempts a class/method from having its line numbers tampered with. |
| LocalVariables | Exempts a class/method from having its local variables tampered with. |
| NumberObfuscation | Exempts a class/method from having its integer and long constants obfuscated. |
| HideCode | Exempts a class/method/field from having access codes added into its flags. |
| Crasher | Exempts a class from having an invalid type signature being added. |
| Expiration | Exempts a class/method from having an expiration code block being inserted. |
| Optimizer | Exempts a class/method from attempting to be optimized. |
| Shrinker | Exempts a class/methods from attempting to strip information/code Radon deems unnecessary. |
| Shuffler | Exempts a class from having its members (methods and fields) order randomized. |
| SourceName | Exempts a class from having its source name debugging information being tampered with. |
| SourceDebug | Exempts a class from having its source debug information being tampered with. |
| StringPool | Exempts a class/method from having its string literals pooled. |
| Renamer | Exempts a class/method/field from being renamed. |

## FAQ
* **Q: Is this uncrackable/undeobfuscatable?**
* *A: No. Nothing is impossible to deobfuscate or reverse-engineer. Furthermore, Radon is far from being hard to deobfuscate.*
* **Q: Why is this open-sourced?**
* *A: I made Radon as a way to experiment with obfuscation and to become familar with the JVM bytecode instruction set and as a codebase if anyone wants to mess around.*
* **Q: Doesn't that make it easier to deobfuscate?**
* *A: Probably.*
* **Q: Why are concepts taken directly from other obfuscators/bytecode manipulation tools? (i.e. expiration transformer which is directly based on Allatori's expiration obfuscation)**
* *A: I thought those would be interesting to include in an obfuscation tool. This is also one of the reasons Radon is open-sourced.*
* **Q: My Java 9+ installation doesn't have a rt.jar! What do I do?**
* *A: Try [this](https://github.com/Storyyeller/jrt-extractor).
